# Contribute

## Where to contribute

Feel free to pick any of the open issues, or to tackle any bugs you encounter.

If you have a feature request, please open an Issue before you start something -- I have maybe already considered that feature and done some preliminary work.

I18n is missing for all languages except en and de -- you can pick any human or inhuman language and add translations for it. But please note that since there are still many features to be developed, the translation files will have to be kept in sync by someone afterwards.

## How to contribute

* Fork the project.
* Do your changes.
* Execute all tests. (test_*.py)
* Lint the code using flake8. (I use the python3.5 version.) Codes E501 and F821 can currently be ignored.
* Commit everything and make a pull request.

Small stuff can happily be pushed to master, for now.

Have fun!
