# rostermaker

## Introduction

This is a program that automatically creates a monthly roster (work schedule) for several employees of a company.

Note that this is work in progress, and a lot of things need to be generalized.

## Requirements

(Will be completed)

CLI only, so should run across most platforms.

* python 3.5+ (earlier not tested yet)
* Python packages:

## Installation

No installation required. It should run out of the box.

## Usage

Set all the variables in a file in the rostermaker/ subfolder, called 'input'. Then simply run 'python run.py' there.

Currently, also the output files will be stored in the rostermaker/ subfolder.

## Contribute

When this project is made public, you can in principle contribute to it. Small stuff can be done at any time. I will name larger challenges under "Issues".
