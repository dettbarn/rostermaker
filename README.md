# rostermaker

## Introduction

This is a program that automatically creates a monthly roster (work schedule) for several employees of a company.

Note that this is work in progress, and a lot of things need to be generalized.

## Requirements

(Will be completed)

CLI only, so should run across most platforms.

* python 3.5+ (earlier not tested yet)
* Python packages:

## Installation

No installation required. It should run out of the box.

## Usage

So far there is no GUI; you call the program from the command line and also operate it there.

    cd rostermaker
    python3 cli.py

Output formats that are supported: .dat, .csv, .tex, .html, .xml, and .json.

In principle everyone can contribute to the rostermaker project. Small stuff can be done at any time. See also the "Issues" tab. Please look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.
